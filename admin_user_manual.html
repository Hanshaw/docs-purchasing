            <h2>Scope of Purchasing</h2>
            <p class="lead">Each employee plays an active role in the purchasing function. Many of them requisition goods and services, while others are directly involved in the purchase of such goods and services. Most of what they use in their daily work, from the paper they write on to the wax on the floors has been acquired through Purchasing. Since everyone is involved in purchasing, the Purchasing Department, in accordance with their own existing policies will determine and clarify what is expected of each involved in the purchase of goods and services.</p>

Statements of purchasing policies and objectives, responsibilities of various individuals and departments, and procedures for the performance of some of the major purchasing functions is the responsibility of the company to disseminate.</p>
