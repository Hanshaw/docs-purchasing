            <p class="lead">Each employee plays an active role in the purchasing function.

Most of what they use in their daily work, from the paper they write on to the wax on the floors has been acquired through Purchasing. Since everyone is involved in purchasing, the Purchasing Department, in accordance with their own existing policies will determine and clarify what is expected of each involved in the purchase of goods and services.</p>

            <strong>System Flow Description</strong>
            <p>User of this system may request for any items needed with the approval of their Department Head. After submission, a Purchase Request number will be generated that will go through several process. Once approved by the respective head department, admin will assign the generated purchase request to the canvasser for necessary canvassing. Once canvassed and no other concern needed from the user, canvasser will forward it back to admin for endorsement to budget, who approves amount presented. Depending on the company's set policy on the purchasing process, there may be an amount set that needs to go through higher approval.  And so the sysytem is designed to standardized it and review is required to generate a PO for this kind of transaction.</p>
            <p>A purchase order will be generated after it passes through the budget approval. At this point, necessary accounting entries will be formulated once audited by the auditing user. This is almost the end point of the process because once admin receives all necessary approval and endorsement of the generated P.O., it will just then be awaiting delivery for the property user to account accuracy of order processed.</p>
            <p>Every data entered in the system will be recorded and reports can easily be printed if needed. Email notifications each user will be activated and status of each step taken will be accounted for necessary monitoring and order execution.</p>
